## Repository Contents

### Files
indicators.csv
Description: This file contains the raw data for 42 of the indicators used in the Community Resilience Index. This excludes the data for two indicators, which were used under license/special agreement for the current study, and so are not publicly available. The data for the retail vacancies indicator may be accessed under licence from the Consumer Data Research Centre and the data on assets of community value can be obtained from Plunkett UK. 
Format: CSV

index.csv

The City of London (the financial district, with a population of 8,600 residents) and Isles of Scilly (with a population of 2,100 residents) were excluded from our study due to their very small population sizes. 
Format: CSV
